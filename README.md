## **Description**

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, my challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## **Questions**

The following questions exist on our end, and are currently trying to be solved:

- Why does the update employee function require the position question to be asked first and then the employee name question second?
- How can I use async/await functions to clean up the code and prevent query nesting? How can I create and properly use methods to dry out the code more?

---

## **Bugs**

Below is a list of known bugs that currently exist within the app:

- The updateEmployeePosition() function only works if the position question is asked first and then the employee name question second
- Methods for displaying answer choices work properly for some questions, but not for others.
